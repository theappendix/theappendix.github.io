    <h3>Edward Emerson Barnard</h3>

<h5>(1857-1923)</h5>

<!-- 1 -->
<div class="paragraph-pack"><p id="paragraph-1">
Born before the war, I was still a boy<br />
when Union soldiers strutted along<br />
the Streets of Nashville with their<br />
glinting guns, and at nine, poverty drove me<br />
to the corner of Fourth and Union where<br />
on long sunny days I stood patiently,<br />
holding steady the lens of a device<br />
that captured the sun, in order that<br />
my employer’s photographs could<br />
be enlarged. But it was at night<br />
my true work was done, gazing<br />
towards the heavens. I will never forget<br />
the day a book fell into my hand that<br />
told me how the Greeks and Arabs<br />
had already been about this same business,<br />
and so I learned the names of things.<br />
My first telescope was made from a<br />
broken spyglass found in the street.<br />
I did not search for reward but what luck<br />
that the Warner Prize then considered<br />
each newly discovered comet to be worth<br />
200.00! One comet bought my house lot,<br />
and just as I grew anxious, another appeared<br />
to help pay off my loan.<br />
Eventually, I drew up my courage, enquiring<br />
if there might be a place for me at Vanderbilt.<br />
When Mr. Newcomb gently said ‘no,’<br />
citing my lack of education in math,<br />
I nodded, then quietly drew myself behind<br />
one of the state capitol columns and wept.<br />
Eventually, they invited me to live on a<br />
small house on campus, understanding<br />
somehow that love is its own expertise.<br />
I took classes, and continued the work I had<br />
always done, charting the skies, mapping<br />
the Milky Way, in cold seasons wearing<br />
animals on my arms: a reindeer hide<br />
coat that more than once led me to surmise<br />
how the ancestors of these stitched skins<br />
must have tracked miles and miles over<br />
the hills, December evenings, nostril fumes<br />
rising above their antlers and then up<br />into the unsurpassable territory.<br />
<br />
<br />
</p></div>

<h3>Sylvester Graham</h3>

<h5>(1794-1851)</h5>

<!-- 2 -->
<div class="paragraph-pack"><p id="paragraph-2">
“Let me,” said I, “Speak til I can speak no<br />
more.” To urge the weak to better thoughts.<br />
Once I only spoke in the pulpit, admonishing,<br />
but then I became convinced I must go<br />
to halls and meeting places—that part of the fold<br />
which would never come in on its own accord.<br />
Old Deacon Slaw gave me trouble for it at first, angered<br />
that I would even dare compare our systems to that<br />
of the motley Orangutan! Yet said I, the Designer<br />
who made us varied and diverse is not above copying<br />
certain methodologies, and what harm befalls our<br />
unique place in creation if our alimentary needs<br />
slightly compare to those of other creatures?<br />
I would preach out of the gospels and epistles, yet<br />
would return to my one theme at any spare hour.<br />
For yes, though our Lord taught that foodstuffs<br />
coming into a man’s mouth do not make him unclean,<br />
but, rather, the envy, malice, and lust inside him,<br />
could not these two things, traced at some lengths,<br />
be somewhat connected? So I traveled and I preached<br />
against the tea, coffee, and tobacco, the cow milk of<br />
cows fed on distillery mash. And though we ought to cry<br />
for daily bread, I taught that bread must more than suffice,<br />
the additives left out, along with the alum and chlorine—<br />
its deceptive pleasing whiteness left for the moral inducing<br />
timber of whole wheat. The milk should run also clear<br />
of the chalk and plaster of Paris lies that stain it<br />
a most unnatural hue. And I did not stop preaching,<br />
nay even in Boston when the city bakers threatened<br />
a riot, warning young men against the all too present<br />
temptation to twiddle themselves, the excesses that<br />
lead to coughs, loss of appetite, and failure of the liver<br />
and kidneys; I also spoke to married couples of<br />
the lassitude that comes of constant overindulging.<br />
One day near the end of my life, when I was traveling<br />
I got out of my carriage and spotted a brilliant blue<br />
butterfly resting on the side of a dry goods store,<br />
and drawn by the glorious sheen, I stepped closer,<br />
only to find another shape resting directly underneath<br />
the one, and I wondered in secret, tho not for the first time—<br />
if our minds are to always run to far higher things, why<br />
even the smallest specks have been fashioned against us.
