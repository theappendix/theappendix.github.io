The temporary hospital was established at the start of the epidemic, but I have paid little attention to it until recently. My impression was that the management was haphazard at best and it was said that the hospital was struggling to keep up with the demands created by this odious plague. \n\nNow, however, it occurs to me that I might be able to learn something more about this fever by visiting the hospital and seeing what they have learned from treating so many cases. Assuming, that is, that the hospital is anything more than a mass grave. I hail a carriage and set out to the manor.\n\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;div class = &quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/issues/2/2/fever/ellipsis.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\nUpon my arrival at the makeshift hospital, I am impressed by the orderliness of things. I feared the hospital would be grossly understaffed, as each day that the cloud of sickness hovers over our city makes nurses harder and harder to find. But I am pleased to see that the hospital is quite respectable indeed.\n\nManagement of the hospital has been recently taken over by two local merchants, Stephen Girard and Peter Helm. Neither is a physician, and yet by taking charge of the city's sick and destitute, they demonstrate their bravery and compassion at a time when many physicians are refusing to perform their sworn duties.  \n\nI ask how they are treating these fever victims. Mr. Girard is a busy man, but he spares a few moments to show me around. I am surprised to find that at Bush Hill, they have chosen to ignore Dr. Rush's aggressive treatment and offer mostly clean environs and restorative care for the fever patients.\n\n&ldquo;Does it really work?&rdquo; I ask.\n\n&ldquo;Of course, we lose patients every day,&rdquo; Mr. Girard replies. &ldquo;But many survive as well. I do not think anyone has the means right now to cure everyone. But we provide the best care possible.&rdquo;\n\nHis words are humble, but I can see a fire in his eyes that tells me that he is as committed to fighting this fever as even the best physicians in this city.\n\nPerhaps I should [[volunteer my services|volunteer]] as a physician. After all, it looks like they will need all the able hands they can find. \n\nThen again, it would seem that the hospital is shaping up quite admirably without me.

By some accounts, the dead are being laid to rest at a rate of upwards of 150 a day. Few who remain in the city who have been untouched by this scourge. Then again, there are few who remain in the city at all. Of our usual 50,000 residents, nearly 20,000 have fled. Most do not feel it is safe to return. \n\nAt times it seems as though the only ones still working in this city seem to be the private nurses, many of whom now command a sum only the wealthiest denizens can afford. And of course, there are the wagons, still wending their way up and down the city streets, their haunting calls, &ldquo;Bring out your dead!&rdquo; echoing in the otherwise silent streets. \n\nWill this Judgment on the poor inhabitants of Philadelphia never end? \n\n&lt;&lt;if $wife eq 'dead'&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display 'wifeDead'&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;else if $track eq 10 || $track eq 5 || $track eq 8&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display 'myDying'&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;else if $track eq 6 &gt;&gt;The death of my eldest son has left me reeling.

It is very real and it is ruthlessly laying waste to the good people of Philadelphia. For each soul carried off by the fever, a church bell tolls. The church bells of the city have been tolling day and night.\n\nThe disease is being referred to as the &ldquo;Yellow Fever&rdquo; for the way that the skin and eyes of those affected often takes on a yellowish hue, although this distinctive symptom is not present in every case.\n\nMany newspapers, both local and national, have ceased printing as a result of the pestilence. In the few that continue to circulate, I have seen ads taken out by Dr. Rush, suggesting that he has found a cure for the disease. I would very much like to believe that this is true, but from what I have seen, the yellow fever travels through the city unabated. Those of us who remain in the city can only hope that this dreadful trial shall soon come to an end.\n\n&lt;&lt;if $track eq 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display 'brewTrack'&gt;&gt;\s\n&lt;&lt;else if $track eq 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display 'dirtyboyTrack'&gt;&gt;\s\n&lt;&lt;else if $track eq 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display 'conservativeTrack'&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="return" tags="" modified="201405061416" created="201307151023" twine-position="1970,1550" modifier="twee">&lt;&lt;if $badinvestigator eq 'false' && $remove eq 'false'&gt;&gt;\s\nAs I am not in the business of caring for the dead, so the corpse shall just have to remain where it is until the mother is recovered enough to have it removed to a cemetery.\n\nRight now, my concern is for the living, and it seems the woman will not be long for this world if I do not intervene swiftly and decisively.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $badinvestigator eq 'true'&gt;&gt;Right now, my concern is for the living, and it seems the woman will not be long for this world if I do not intervene swiftly and decisively.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nIt is hard to say for certain what the cause of the woman's illness is, although the death of the young child may be a clue. Although I am loath to approach the woman again, I must examine her throat. \n\nAh, yes! Her tongue is quite red in color, as are the tonsils, fauces, and uvula.\n\n&lt;html&gt; &lt;div class = &quot;image&quot;&gt; &lt;img id=&quot;mouth&quot; src=&quot;/images/issues/2/2/fever/grayMouth.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;p class = &quot;caption&quot;&gt;The woman's tongue, tonsils, fauces, and uvula are inflamed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n\nThe high fever, rapid pulse, red tongue and throat all suggest to me that she has a serious case of scarlet fever. Lately, I have seen many instances of the mild variety of scarlatina simplex affecting children in our city. It is entirely probably that both she and her dead child managed to contract the more complex and dangerous variety, scarlatina anginosa.\n\nTrue, the disease is not as common among adults as it is children, but it would not be unprecedented. Yes, I say scarlatina is a plausible, nay, a sensible diagnosis. Why then, am I hesitating? &lt;&lt;if $talk_to_rush eq &quot;yes&quot;&gt;&gt;Is it possible this could, in fact, be a case of the terrible yellow fever that Dr. Rush described?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n&lt;&lt;set $paths[2]=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $track=2&gt;&gt;\n[[I trust myself and will treat for scarlet fever.|boy_patient_2]]\n[[I am plagued by doubt.

Mr. Brewster, what is he talking about?&rdquo;\n\nMr. Berry looks at his employer with a look of wild desperation. In response, Mr. Brewster flashes me a sharp look&mdash;I am disappointed that the old merchant does not appear to understand the vital importance of getting at all the facts. \n\n&ldquo;Please, Mr. Berry, get a hold of yourself,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;We have only just begun our work here. Now, I must take your pulse.&rdquo;\n\nMr. Brewster tries to calm the young clerk down, but to little effect. If we cannot settle him, it is going to be impossible to get an accurate assessment.\n\n&ldquo;Mr. Berry, please,&rdquo; I say sternly, &ldquo;there is no need to act like a child. Now settle yourself. We shall take your pulse in a minute, when you are calm. In the meantime, let me examine your throat. Please, open your mouth, wide, sir.&rdquo;\n\nThe clerk still has a wild look about him. Must he be so petulant and defiant? \n\nI demand once more that he open his mouth. This time, he swallows hard and complies. His tongue is red and smooth, almost glistening in appearance. His throat appears inflamed, but not overly so. I should like a closer look, but Mr. Berry is now squirming under my gaze. Why can this petulant man not be still?\n\n&ldquo;Mr. Berry, please&mdash;&rdquo; but I am unable to finish my thought. With no warning at all, Mr. Berry begins vomiting. \n\nMr. Brewster and I both attempt to dodge the vile discharge, but we are without success. The poor clerk is like a font of foul, black vomit. I have never in my life seen anything quite like this. \n\nAfter a seemingly interminable length of time, Mr. Berry's vomiting at last ceases. I am at a loss for what to do with the man, whose illness bears no resemblance to any I know. I tell Mr. Brewster to have one of his maids bring clean bedclothes and some strong, cold chamomile tea to help relieve the man of his nausea.  \n\nMr. Brewster and I step outside the room while these preparations are underway.\n\n&ldquo;This is indeed a surprising case, Mr. Brewster. I advise you to see to it that the young man takes a few drops of elixir of vitriol should his vomiting be unquieted by the cold tea. See that he does not leave that room until I can research his symptoms further.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;As you wish, Dr. Brooks.

I shall return tomorrow to see her and visit the clerk again.&rdquo;\n\nAlthough Mr. Brewster is not the type of man to show it, I am certain I see the unmistakable traces of fear in the furrows of his brow. I wish that I could give him an assurance that all will be well.\n\nI should [[go home now|homejump]] and change clothes.\n</div><div tiddler="dropdead_end" tags="" modified="201402162338" created="201402042056" twine-position="2060,5187" modifier="twee">With each step, my feet feel like they are full of lead.

However, I can shield my family from sharing in whatever terrible fate may be in store for those who remain in this pestilential city.\n\nPerhaps there will be nothing to this disease, but if it is even half as bad as Dr. Rush fears, the days ahead will almost certainly be harrowing. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, during outbreaks of the black plague, the public often became hysterical with fear. Chaos reigned the streets of afflicted cities, and those fearing the end of days would march through the streets, flagellating themselves as an outrageous gesture of penitence. \n\nAlthough I am confident that our native citizens are made of greater stuff than the peasants of medieval times, I still fear the amount of civil disorder that might spring from an outbreak of this modern day yellow plague.

But I am here now and chastising the man further is not apt to do much good. Instead, I ask him to take me to my patients.\n\nThe woman and children are in a bad way, but I do believe they are not beyond hope.

At this point, there is little that can be done but wait.\n \nI tell Mr. Pierce that I must now leave and attend to other patients.\n\n&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he says, a frantic look in his eye. &ldquo;You can't leave.

Before I proceed with the examination, I take Mr. Brewster aside and ask if the clerk is always so pungently odiferous. He assures me that the clerk is a most fastidious man, never negligent in the care of his toilette. \n\nTurning back to the clerk, I see that he is rather visibly uncomfortable. Nevertheless, he insists that he has merely a touch of the normal summer ague and nothing more. Much like the housemaid, I notice that his skin has an [[unusual, slightly yellow pallor to it|unusualskin]], but I am undecided about pressing the issue, given Mr. Brewster's insight regarding the man's vanity.\n\nI take Mr. Berry's pulse, which is rapid but full.

Sarah's slap burns across my face, but I have no chance to scold her.

It would not be wise to delay now that I can no longer deny being afflicted. Although now that I am facing the prospect personally, I wonder whether it is preferable to be carried off quickly or to face the slow, lingering death that this cruel fever can also produce.\n\nWhile I wait in the house for Sarah to hail someone to transport me to the fever hospital, John Jr. comes over and sits by my side.\n\n&ldquo;Father, are you dying?&rdquo; he asks. \n\nI should like to think I am telling him the truth when I answer, &ldquo;No, son.

And then after a long pause, &ldquo;How do you know if you have the fever, Father?&rdquo;\n\nThe question troubles me. Why does he ask that? Is it just boyish curiosity?

The carriage is waiting but he won't wait for long.&rdquo;\n\nI want to question John, Jr. further, but Sarah proves to be incredibly strong. She half pushes, half drags me to the door in spite of my resistance. \n\n&ldquo;Perhaps the boy should come with me,&rdquo; I say, but Sarah doesn't seem to hear me as she stuffs me headlong into the carriage. She slams the door as sends the driver off in a hurry.\n\nI turn behind me and take a long look as the carriage pulls away.

But surely there must be a rope or something at these docks that I could throw to her. \n\nI see some large coils of rope used for tying ships to the dock, but they are much too big toss to the girl. There must be something...\n\nOf course! The passenger vessel! What a fool I am not to think of this sooner. I run to the bow of the ship and shout out to the captain for a rope. He is reluctant to comply.\n\n&ldquo;Damn it, man. A woman has fallen into the water,&rdquo; I explain. &ldquo;She's drowning. There's no time to waste!&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;Well why didn't you say so?&rdquo; The captain replies curtly. In an instant, he has raised the cry of &ldquo;man overboard&rdquo; to his entire crew. \n\nTwo sailors immediately plunge from the vessel into the water. I point to where the girl was last seen, even though there is no trace of her at the surface now. But the sailors are undeterred. They dive under the water in search of the young woman.  \n\nAfter what seems like ages, they resurface, pulling up the motionless girl behind them. They bring her to the water's edge and I help them hoist the soggy woman onto the pier.\n\nI quickly begin to examine her for any signs of life, but I see none. I cover the woman with my coat in an effort to warm her, and I ask the captain for a bellows. One is quickly delivered to me by one of his men. \n\nI place the instrument in her mouth and begin gently pumping in air. I keep this activity up for a solid five minutes, but there is no response from the woman. I must admit defeat. She is drowned.\n\nThe crowd that had gathered, no doubt hoping to witness a resuscitation, disappointedly disperses. I, too, am disappointed. I cannot help but wonder if my hesitation to jump into the water may have cost the girl her life.\n\nThere is little I can do now but continue on with the task that brought me to the docks in the first place: dispensing Dr. Rush's purgative pills. I search my coat pockets for the box, but what's this? It seems that in my efforts to save the girl, my coat and the box of pills within it were soaked.

Mr. Brewster, stops me, however, and speaks harshly to the clerk:\n\n&ldquo;Mr. Berry, you will do as the doctor says or you will look for employment elsewhere.&rdquo;\n\nThe man is clearly distraught by the options before him. Reluctantly, he starts to undress. As he does, the foul odor we smelled upon entering the room becomes stronger. It suddenly becomes clear why the clerk was so hesitant to comply.\n\nIt appears that while I was attending the housemaid, the poor man vomited upon himself and then tried to conceal the mess underneath his coat and the bedsheets.  \n\nAs more and more of the voided substance is revealed, I can see that his vomit is quite remarkable, both in terms of its unpleasant stench and its appearance. The vomit is almost entirely black in color and clumped together, almost like rotten coffee grounds. It is exceedingly foul.\n\nIn addition to the unpleasant discovery of the vomit, it is also now readily apparent that the clerk's discolored skin is not confined to his face. His entire body seems to have taken on an unnaturally yellow hue. I have never seen a case quite like this before.\n\nI ask Mr. Brewster to step out of the room with me while the clerk redresses. \n\n&ldquo;This is indeed a surprising case, Mr. Brewster. I advise you to see to it that the young man takes a few drops elixir of vitriol should his vomiting be unquieted by the cold tea. See that he does not leave that room until I can research his symptoms further.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;As you wish, Dr. Brooks.&rdquo; Although Mr. Brewster is not the type of man to show it openly, I am certain I see the unmistakable traces of fear in the furrows of his brow.

Of course, she wanted to kick him out, but I convinced her to let him stay in the basement. She'll be furious if the other boarders discover him. It's already hard enough to let rooms in a town overwhelmed by a plague.&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;And why are you not afraid like everyone else?&rdquo; I ask her, still doubtful or her motives.\n\nShe motions me toward the basement door before beginning her answer.\n\n&ldquo;I first starting nursing people back when everyone believed us blacks couldn't get the disease.

You're putting yourself at quite a risk.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I'm in no hurry to die, if that's what you're asking. But I've got two boys to provide for and this here is a job no one seems to want to do.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; I say, now that her venal motives are revealed. &ldquo;So you charge 'these poor afflicted folks.' Handsomely, too, I suspect.&rdquo; \n\nWe have managed to get the man inside the basement apartment and now set him down gently on his makeshift bed. When we're through, I see the woman giving me a fierce and unexpectedly defiant look.\n\n&ldquo;I didn't ask for and don't expect you to understand,&rdquo; she says.\n\n&ldquo;Oh, I understand, all right. I understand vulgar extortion when I see it!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;And I suppose you perform your labor for free?&rdquo; She pauses and looks me up and down, &ldquo;Or maybe a gentleman like you's just born with so much money that you don't have to work like the rest of us&rdquo; she retorts. \n\n&ldquo;I'll have you know I lost my husband to the fever not two weeks ago,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;I know full well how these people suffer. I have no desire to take advantage of the sick or their families during such a time of suffering, but I'm in no position to run a charity. So yes, I //vulgarly// accept payment from those who will offer it.&rdquo;\n\nShe begins to pour out water for the still-unconscious sailor, but pauses to berate me further. &ldquo;Just because there are some nurses who stand before the sick and refuse to offer them aid until they agree to pay exorbitant fees, doesn't mean we're all like that. You better leave now before you get your delicate hands dirty working with a //vulgar// person like myself!&rdquo;\n\nI am quite shocked by her indignant outburst. It is possible that I perhaps judged her too harshly. As a means of apology, I offer up my services as a healer, but she appears to be thoroughly unmoved by my generosity.\n\n&ldquo;No wonder you think I'm a thief,&rdquo; she say, shaking her head in disbelief. &ldquo;Everybody knows doctors'll rob the blind and their medicines'll make a person sicker than the disease. You get on out of here and let me and this poor dying man alone!&rdquo;\n\nShe picks up a dirty old broom and chases me out of the apartment. No sooner do I set foot outside, but she closes the door and latches the bolt. \n\nI suppose I must consider myself thoroughly reprimanded. I had thought that we physicians would be a welcome presence in any home given the circumstances, but it would seem that not everyone is convinced of our utility. \n\nMoreover, it seems that I, too, am guilty of doubting the utility of others. Although there are those who have taken advantage of our city's crisis to enrich themselves from the troubles of others, it would seem that I had overlooked the possibility that many who remain in service to this city do so neither for riches nor for lofty ideals. Instead they labor under an ethos of mutual benefit. \n\nIt is a peculiar notion to me, I admit, but it might behoove me to treat such people with a bit more kindness than I did tonight.

And yet, after the loss of Matthew and Louisa, I cannot bring myself to say I am a lucky man.\n\nI have a vague recollection of collapsing in the street, but little memory of what followed. From what I was told, the man with the dead took me to a nearby Quaker meeting house. I was delirious with fever and thirst, but they nursed me back to health. When I had recovered sufficiently, I was reunited with my wife and John, Jr.\n\nNow, finally, a significant cooling of the weather this last week seems to have finally brought about an end to the wretched yellow fever. Why this is so, I cannot guess, but it is with mixed feelings that I contemplate the fever's departure. Of course, it brings me great joy to know that we no longer have to suffer in fear from this terrible affliction. At last our city's dead can be properly mourned and laid to rest. \n\nAt the same time, however, this yellow fever remains a great mystery. I wish that I had learned more about it while it was here so that I might be better able to protect my family should this terrible fever ever return. \n\n\nTHE END.\n----\n&lt;&lt;display 'ending tracker'&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="lawyer" tags="" modified="201403161906" created="201310192232" twine-position="1990,4295" modifier="twee">I can no longer deny the very real possibility that I might not live to see the end of this epidemic. I must make certain that my affairs are in order.\n\nThere are but few lawyers who remain in this city, and I suspect it will not be easy to find one to help me draw up my last will and testament. If I recall, the small law office of Castle & Agar seemed to be conducting business when I passed by last week. I guess it is a place to start.\n\nThe streets are a sorry sight these days. The carters work hard to keep the bodies of the dead off the street, but there are often too few wagons available to collect the number of dead.\n\nWhen the almshouses began turning away those with even the slightest signs of infection, the poor, diseased wretches would all too often simply die on the street. There are fewer these days, due to so many having been carried off already, but today I find a body stretched out on the middle of Arch street. By all appearances, it has been lying there for several days.\n\nThe rotting corpse proves to be the only human I see on the journey to the office of Castle & Agar, so desolate are the streets these days. Much to my chagrin, it seems that the law office is also desolate. A small sign posted on the door informs me that Messrs. Agar and Castle have both succumbed to the fever and their offices shall remain closed indefinitely.\n\nI am beginning to despair. I was a fool to wait until now to try and put my affairs in order. I want to [[continue looking for a lawyer|law_dropdead]], but my strength is giving out.

My dear boy John, Jr. succumbed to the fever within just a few days of being in their home.\n\nThe only good that has come to pass in this city lately is the recent ceasation of the church bells. They used to toll both day and night, so plentiful are the deaths from fever. But now they stand silent not because they deaths are fewer, but because all normal discourse in the city has ground to a halt in the hopes of preventing the fever's further spread. \n\nIf I am to be honest, the silence is a relief. For a time, those bells only served to bring terror to the living, and hopelessness to the sick and in despair.

Not only did we fail to reach any satisfactory answers about this yellow fever, but to see this vicious squabbling among such learned and accomplished men was truly a tragedy, especially in these trying times. It looks as though I shall be on my own in trying to decide how to treat this fever. But at least I now know more about its prevailing characteristics.\n\nIt is late when I arrive home, and I am surprised to see a lamp still lit in the children's bedroom. I enter the room only to see Sarah stooped down over John, Jr.\n\nThe boy looks pale, his eyes watery and lips dry.\n\n&ldquo;What's going on?&rdquo; I ask.\n\n&ldquo;Oh John,&rdquo; Sarah replies, &ldquo;little John has felt poorly ever since he returned from the wharves.&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;No!

I am starting to regret having agreed to make this detour before returning home, but it was hard to refuse the old man's request.\n\nI at last reach the small living quarters on Water Street and begin to search for Mr. Cook's grandson. Usually I would imagine a building like this one would be full of motion and sound with tenants coming in from a hard day's labor or going for drink and entertainment. \n\nBut tonight the building is nearly silent. Were it not for the occasional creek of a rotting wooden floorboard behind closed doors, I would wonder if the whole building were deserted. I doubt I will get any help from the neighbors tonight in tracking down the younger Cook. \n\nI look for the room Mr. Cook has sent me to find. Although there are neither names nor numbers on any of the doors, I believe I have found the apartment the old man described. I knock on the door.

The estate's location outside the city center both protects any uninfected city residents from the putrid exhalations of the sick, while also offering fever victims themselves a respite from the oppressive, miasmatic airs of the city.\n\nThe temporary hospital was established at the start of the epidemic, but it has only come to my attention of late as it has been recently placed under the stewardship of one of our city's most esteemed merchants, Mr. Stephen Girard. \n\nI hope that I will find him an eager recipient of my knowledge about a treatment.\n\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;div class = &quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/issues/2/2/fever/ellipsis.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\nAfter a lengthy carriage ride, I arrive at the doorstep of Bush Hill. I had expected the place to be chaotic, but I am surprised and impressed by the orderliness of the hospital.\n\nI have but little time to waste. I attempt to gain the attention of a nearby nurse, but she brushes past me in a rush, barely acknowledging my presence.\n\nNot to be discouraged, I try again to announce myself, this time as a male attendant passes through the hall. He, too, seems indifferent to me. \n\nHe rushes to the bedside of a man who has begun vomiting up the now familiar, but indescribably repulsive, black discharge that is characteristic of this disease. How the attendant manages not to flinch at the horrid, spasmodic evacuations of the wretched man, I do not know.\n\nTurning away, I make my way down the hall and finally manage to command the attention of a nurse by forcibly grabbing her arm.\n\n&ldquo;I understand that Mr. Stephen Girard is in charge here.

The interior of the house is bustling with activity. Patients of all stages of the fever seem to fill every nook and cranny of the home, and I see several of Dr. Rush's assistants, covered in blood-stained garments, moving swiftly throughout the building. \n\nI have to wait a good half hour before Dr. Rush can find the time to pry himself away from his patients. He looks weak, but I can see a fire burning in his eyes.\n\n&ldquo;I have discovered how to defeat this thing!&rdquo;  Dr. Rush proclaims. \n\n&lt;html&gt; &lt;div class = &quot;image&quot;&gt; &lt;img id=&quot;rushagain&quot; src=&quot;/images/issues/2/2/fever/rush2.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;p class = &quot;caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Rush looks at me with a fire burning in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\nI find myself momentarily speechless by his dramatic revelation, but fortunately, the good doctor is not at a similar loss for words.\n\n&ldquo;I was too cautious at first,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;My patients died because of my hesitation. I thought a conventional bleeding would effect a cure, but I was wrong.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;But if bleeding is no use, then dare I ask why your assistants' clothing is stained so?&rdquo; I ask, at last able to find my tongue.\n\n&ldquo;Ah, I didn't say bleeding was of no use,&rdquo; Rush responds with an enigmatic grin. &ldquo;Bleeding is essential. And I am living proof of that!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;What do you mean? Have you suffered the yellow fever?&rdquo; I ask him.\n\n&ldquo;Suffered and survived!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The mistake is not in the bleeding, but in the timing of it! We must wait for the disease to turn before the bleedings are administered.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Wait for the disease to turn? I am not certain I follow you, Dr. Rush.&rdquo; I am as eager anyone to find a cure for this terrible visitation, but as I struggle to understand Dr. Rush's explanation, I cannot help but wonder if the fever may have affected his brain.\n\nDr. Rush seems to read my thoughts. &ldquo;My apologies. I am letting my excitement get the best of me. Let me try to be more clear: purgatives, Dr. Brooks! Purgatives must come first. At least three doses, at least 10 grams of jalop and 10 grams of calomel in each dose.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Dr. Rush, I believe I have misheard you.&rdquo; I know well how useful purgatives can be in quieting many an illness, but 60 grams? &ldquo;At that dose, the evacuations would surely be worse than the fever itself.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;And now you are making the same mistake I once did. Yes, Dr. Brooks, at least 60 grams, to be applied //without reservation//, until at least four or five large evacuations have been produced. The purgatives themselves are often enough by themselves to bring about a cure. But, to be safe, it is best to use the purgatives in conjunction with blood-letting in order to remove excess of stimulus from the system. It is this overstimulation that makes this disease fatal to its victims.&rdquo;\n\nOnce again I find myself at a loss for words. I respect my mentor greatly, but I don't see how I can share his confidence about such an aggressive therapy. Still, if he is right, many people could be saved from death by yellow fever.\n\nI thank Dr. Rush for his time and insight and make ready my departure. \n\n&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he says, thrusting a small box in my hands. &ldquo;As you can see, I already have all the patients I can handle. Take these pills with you and head to the docks. That area is the epicenter of this epidemic, and there are a great many of the infected who need a physician's care. Bring them my cure. //Save them!//&rdquo;\n\nI look at the box of powerful purgatives. Dr. Rush is convinced that they are the key to stopping this fever, of that there can be no doubt. But I am not so certain.\n\nAt this moment, however, there is no arguing with the man. Dr. Rush practically pushes me out the front door and in the direction of the waterfront. I follow Walnut Street to [[the docks|to_the_docks]].\n\n\n\n</div><div tiddler="wifeDead" tags="" modified="201403182156" created="201307152129" twine-position="575,4096" modifier="twee">&lt;&lt;if $badinvestigator eq &quot;false&quot;&gt;&gt;I blame myself for what happened to Sarah.

We need facts.&lt;html&gt;&rdquo;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n&lt;html&gt;&ldquo;&lt;/html&gt;But surely we ought to begin taking some kind of action.&lt;html&gt;&rdquo;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n&lt;html&gt;&ldquo;&lt;/html&gt;And what would you recommend? The fools with their... apt to set the whole city ablaze.&lt;html&gt;&rdquo;&lt;/html&gt; If only I could hear more of Dr. Hutchinson's response.\n\nI edge even closer, but clumsily. I knock a large book off the desk and it falls to the ground with a frighteningly loud thud.\n\nDr. Hutchinson and his companion glare at me. It would seem they are not pleased at the prospect of having been overheard. I would explain that I am a physician, too, but Dr. Hutchinson is already out the door before I can utter a word. The other physician looks at me for a moment as though he would speak, but chases quickly after Dr. Hutchinson instead.\n\nI wish that I might have learned more, but the bits that I've heard seem to confirm that something is indeed afoot. Is there really an epidemic in progress? Is it confined to the docks, or has it spread? And what can we possibly do about it?\n\nI have more questions now than when I came, and yet no more resources at the moment for answering them. I shall have to pay close attention in [[the coming days|choke_1]] to any further reports of this mysterious illness.\n</div><div tiddler="acknowledgments" tags="" modified="201403231938" created="201304150011" twine-position="990,10" modifier="twee">Many thanks go out to the following people for patiently listening to me talk about this story for the umpteen millionth time and for their editorial insights when I ocassionally lost my way: Christine Colburn, Tim Cornell, [[Dana Rovang|https://twitter.com/@DanaRovang]], Jessica Seidman, and [[Cecelia Watson|https://twitter.com/@CeceliaAWatson]].\n\nI am also abundantly grateful to Christopher Heaney and Brian Jones of //The Appendix// for taking a chance on this crazy experimental story and helping me turn it into a reality.\n\nAnd last but not least, I want to say thank you to my parents.

I can only wonder as to why Mr. Brewster would indulge his strong-willed daughter in letting her remain unwed for so long. I am struck by how distinctly out of place this woman of such charm and stature looks standing amidst the bolts of fabric and spools of garish ribbons. \n\n&ldquo;Where are the regular clerks?&rdquo; I ask her, unable to contain my impolite curiosity.\n\nMiss Brewster's face sinks at my query. &ldquo;Oh, it's just terrible! Mr. Berry was minding the store this morning when he suddenly fainted. We rushed him upstairs as soon as he was discovered. He could barely stand, and his complexion was so strange. We're all dreadfully worried about him. Please say you'll attend to him.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Yes of course&mdash;&rdquo;, but she doesn't let me finish.\n\n&ldquo;And then our housemaid is still sick, even though we sent for a physician just the other day.

After all, it is entirely possible the two illnesses are unrelated.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Yes, I supposed you are right. I just, I have a bad feeling about all of this. It's as though a curse has been placed on our house, or maybe it's the whole city that's cursed...&rdquo;\n\nI can see that she would like to go on, but I don't want to abide her indulgence in speculation and superstition. Interrupting, I remark, &ldquo;While feelings have their place in the home and in the arts, medicine, Miss Brewster, is a science. You'll have to forgive me if I prefer to conduct an empirical investigation rather than rely on mere intuition.&rdquo;\n\nShe falls silent at my reply. Perhaps I should take the opportunity to now [[go upstairs|upstairs]]. The look of hardness on her face suggests that my rebuff may have been a bit too firm, however.

I have tried time and again to comfort her in her grief, but I have had very little success in reaching her. I had hoped that in time, her mind would recover from the horrible shock of Matthew and Louisa's death, but now I can no longer afford to be patient.\n\nI can barely stand, but I stagger down the stairs and find Sarah sitting silently at the kitchen table. Gently, I take her by the hand and ask her to summon a carriage for me. \n\nAt my words, she looks up from her reverie, but she doesn't say a word.\n\n&ldquo;Please Sarah, I have the fever and I need to go to Bush Hill right away.&rdquo; I look into her eyes, searching for some sign that she hears and understands what I'm saying.\n\nAll I see in her eyes in emptiness.\n\nAgain, I ask her to summon a carriage. I plead with her and try to impress upon her the urgency of my situation. But it is to no avail. I fear that she may be permanently deranged by our family's tragedy.  \n\nI would ask John, Jr. to summon a carriage, but since his siblings' deaths, he has not spent much time at the house. Maybe it is his own way of dealing with grief, or maybe he simply cannot bear to see his mother in her current condition.\n\nWhatever the reason, the fact of the matter is that I am, for all intents and purposes, alone now. I shall have to muster the strength to summon a carriage myself.\n\nI feel so very lightheaded as I stumble outside. I force myself not to look at the makeshift coffins and shrouded bodies piled up and down the street.\n\nThere are no carriages to be seen anywhere. \n\nI try to walk to the street corner, hoping for a better chance that some traveler will come by, but every step forward is a trial. My throat burns with thirst now. I feel a sudden trickle of moisture on my lips and instinctively lick at it.\n\nBlood.\n\n[[I cannot walk any further...|extraunhappy_end]]</div><div tiddler="wife_bush" tags="" modified="201405272333" created="201402162301" twine-position="747,3020" modifier="twee">Maybe it would be best to take her to the Bush Hill hospital.

I am distressed to find no carriages seem to be about. Wait&mdash;is that one, just around the corner?\n\nIt is a cab! What relief! But&mdash;he's driving away!\n\n&ldquo;Come back, man. I need a carriage, right away!&rdquo;\n\nBut the driver only shakes his head and bids the horse go faster. What is wrong with him? Can he not see the condition my wife is in?\n\nSarah seems to be quickly fading. She vomits the foul, black vomit characteristic of this disease. Her skin is hot and sallow. She is not long for this world, I am certain.\n\nI must get her to the hospital, but how? Just down the street, I can hear the shrill, chilling cry, &ldquo;Bring out your dead!&rdquo; It is of one of the collectors with his cart, sent to take fever victims to the Potter's Field. \n\n&ldquo;Sir! Please, please help me get my wife to the hospital.&rdquo;\n\nThe man just stares at me, but I will not be deterred. \n\n&ldquo;She is ill and no one is willing to brave the fever. Please, good man, divert from your route and I will pay handsomely.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I can't just leave these bodies,&rdquo; he objects.\n\nThat means we'd have to ride... Oh, no! It is too wretched, too unbearable to even consider. \n\nBut Sarah cannot even stand. I have no choice. Oh, God in Heaven help me for what I must do now!\n\n&ldquo;We'll ride with the bodies.

Even though most are wrapped in some kind of loose shroud or another, the feeling of lifeless hands and feet beneath us is too horrible to describe. And the stench&mdash;I wonder how it is that the man collecting these foul, putrefying sacks does not retch constantly.\n\nBut far more horrifying than the bodies and their smell is my realization that Sarah is not aware of them at all.

But now with the baby sick, and knowing my own fatigue, I wonder if perhaps I am only guaranteeing the boy's sickness by keeping him inside. \n\n&ldquo;John, you should go outside today. We've been in the dark for too long now. See if there's any news. Maybe the worse is over by now.&rdquo;\n\nIt brings me a brief moment of happiness to see the expression of joy on little John's face.

The woman from the filthy apartment in Hell Town lasted little more than a day before her skin yellowed and she was carried off by the mysterious fever with fearful swiftness.\n\nThe dirty boy who had brought me to the house was left with not a soul in the world to care for him. Although I am not in the habit of considering myself a charitable institution, I felt I had no choice but to take the boy in under my own roof. \n\nHappily, he has shown no signs of the disease, and despite my initial impression that he was a dull fellow, he seems to get along with my son John, Jr. quite well. He would not have been my first pick as a playfellow for John, but I am actually relieved that my son now has a friend to take his mind off the current chaos of the city.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nAt the moment, I feel uncertain about how best to apply my talents as a healer in these trying times. I have heard that [[there is a fever hospital|bushhill_1]] set up just outside of town. I do not know whether this place has had any success in treating the yellow fever, but there might be valuable knowledge to be gained from the workers there about the natural course of the illness.\n\nThen again, this impromptu hospital may in practice be nothing more than a charnel house, collecting and disposing of the bodies of the city's dead and soon-to-be. &lt;&lt;if $dirtycure eq &quot;true&quot;&gt;&gt;As I was able to successfully combat the yellow fever in the case of the woman in Hell Town, I must consider the possibility that my technique could save lives. Should I not [[spread the word of my cure|tout_your_cure]]?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Although my skills have once proved useless in the face of this frightening new scourge, I have healed many in the course of my career. There are countless ill in this city, and they cry out for the attention of a physician. Perhaps I should stop doubting myself and [[continue treating them as best I can|eccentric_1]]. Perhaps I will find answers if I treat more cases.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; </div><div tiddler="textinputMacro" tags="script" modified="201401190044" created="201401182337" twine-position="4377,2049" modifier="twee">try {\n      version.extensions['textinput'] = { major:1, minor:0, revision:0 };\n    macros['textinput'] = {\n            handler: function(place, macroName, params, parser) {\n                var v = params[0].replace(&quot;$&quot;,&quot;&quot;);\n\n                var input= document.createElement('input');\n                input.type = &quot;text&quot;;\n        input.size = &quot;40&quot;;\n      input.maxlength = &quot;160&quot;;\n                var d = v+&quot;TextInput&quot;;\n\n                input.id = d;\n                input.addEventListener('keyup', function()\n                {\n                state.history[0].variables[v] = document.getElementById(d).value;\n                });\n                place.appendChild(input);\n            },    \n    };\n    } catch(e) {\n      throwError(place,&quot;textinput Setup Error: &quot;+e.message); \n    }</div><div tiddler="snakedeath" tags="" modified="201402162337" created="201304140253" twine-position="2603,3561" modifier="twee">----\n&lt;&lt;set $ending[3] = 'true'&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $currentEnd=3&gt;&gt;\nDr. Brooks closed his eyes for the last time on &lt;&lt;print $date&gt;&gt;.

The boy stares dumbly at me for a minute more, and then begins leading the way.\n\nHe first leads me to east to Water Street and then turns north. As we pass by the docks, I am struck by the number of idle hands lingering by the wharves. Many seem to be refugees from Saint Domingue, recently delivered to our city after escaping the horrors that three years of war had brought to the French West Indies. I had known of the plight after making a donation earlier this month to a relief fund for these poor souls, but actually seeing entire shipfuls of gaunt and sickly-looking passengers arriving at our ports is an unexpected sight.\n\nMy time for gawking is cut short as now the boy turns us away from the docks and heads toward Elfreth's Alley. The narrow houses here cram an overwhelming amount of humanity into a tiny space. I feel my attention being pulled in every direction by the glassblowers, silversmiths and various small merchants, all plying their trades and hawking their wares. Darting to and fro between the tightly packed buildings are the sailors and dock laborers searching for cheap room and board among the bakers, schoolmistresses, and countless other free laborers who call this place their home. \n\nAlthough my head spins with all the bustling activity here, my thick-headed little companion trudges forward, seemingly unfazed. \n\nAs we tread nearer to the docks, more unsavory elements become visible. We are fast approaching Hell Town, where the city's most disreputable denizens are inclined to congregate. The boy appears to be taking me straight into the figurative lion's den. Prostitutes, fugitive slaves, and the entire gamut of ne'er-do-wells spend their time here merry-making in the numerous taverns and brothels.\n\nWe at last come to a narrow wooden building in a considerable state of disrepair. I can feel the piercing eyes of the neighbors and nearby indigents upon me. The boy beckons me to enter, but my suspicions are again aroused. Does this ragamuffin really need my help, or has he lured me here so that others might do me harm? \n\n[[Turn back.|turnback]] \n[[Continue following the child.|dirtymother]]\n\n\n</div><div tiddler="boy_patient_2" tags="" modified="201404012257" created="201304132320" twine-position="2283,1546" modifier="twee">Her symptoms are typical enough of the disease, even if the patient herself is less so.

I do not have a proper medical bag with me, but I do have some spirit of hartshorn. I use it to revive the man.\n\n&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he asks. I explain to him that he has collapsed in the middle of Chestnut Street.\n\n&ldquo;Where is my nurse?&rdquo; he croaks.\n\n&ldquo;Your nurse?&rdquo; I ask, surprised by the question.\n\nHis voice is barely a whisper now as he explains. &ldquo;A woman from the Free African Society has been helping me these past few days,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;She was here just a moment ago. Perhaps she left to send for a doctor.&rdquo;\n\nI try to conceal my shock at this disturbing revelation. What have I done? Did I really send his nurse to prison? Well, there is no sense troubling the man over it now, not in his current condition. \n\nI help him back into the boarding house across the street. We head for the stairs leading to the rooms upstairs when suddenly he stops.\n\n&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we must go through the back door into the basement. The owner doesn't want anyone here to know there is fever in the house.&rdquo; \n\nI am not altogether surprised. He would not be the first to be turned out because of the fever. I've even heard of family members abandoning one another out of fear of the disease.\n\nWhen we get inside, I offer the man some drink and give him a moderate bleeding to help ease the heat of his fever. As I leave, he asks again about his nurse. I assure him that I will try to discover her whereabouts.\n\nAs I depart the boarding house, I cannot stop thinking about how badly I misjudged this man's poor nurse. I shall go to the jail straightaway and get her released. And though I know there are a great many evils being committed in our city right now, I shall endeavor not to rush to pass judgment on others [[in the coming days|choke_2]].</div><div tiddler="extraunhappy_end" tags="" modified="201402162338" created="201402022138" twine-position="1640,5185" modifier="twee">----\n&lt;&lt;set $ending[8] = 'true'&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $currentEnd=8&gt;&gt;\nDr. Brooks never made it to the Bush Hill hospital.

Normally, it might be a pleasantly scenic carriage ride, but these days it is a trip filled with visions of suffering and woe. \n\nCoffins and shrouds containing the bodies of the dead litter the streets.

My frantic efforts to heal her were to no avail. For three painful days and nights I sat by her side bringing her cold drinks and offering her laudanum in an effort to calm her nausea. I do not know if it was Dr. Rush's pills themselves, or my reluctance for follow the harsh course of treatment through that lead to her demise, all I know is that the fatal illness never lifted. \n\nI began making the preparations for her burial, but was shocked to discover that a proper burial would not be possible under this extraordinary circumstances.

She reports that her husband has fallen ill and fears it may be dreaded yellow fever.\n\nWith no little dread in my heart, I set out in search of the Mills residence.\n\nIt is a rickety house at Arch and Front Street. As I walk into the home, there is a peculiar odor. Not that strange and foul odors are that unusual in this area, so close by the wharves, but the stench permeating this home is quite exceptional.\n\nI try to conceal my revulsion from the occupants, but Mrs. Mills clearly notices my involuntary shudder.\n\n&ldquo;It's that damn coffee!&rdquo; she vulgarly exclaims, pointing emphatically in the direction of the docks. &ldquo;There's rotting coffee on the wharves. They dumped a whole shipload of it a fortnight or so ago, and it's been festering there and souring up the airs all around here ever since. It's sickening the entire neighborhood!&rdquo;\n\nI assure Mrs. Mills that while the odor is unpleasant, I doubt that it is a source of illness, but silently, I offer a prayer of gratitude that I live nowhere near the wharves and this wretched stench.\n\nMrs. Mills gives me such an intense look, I almost wonder if she can't hear my thoughts. Without another word, she gestures me upstairs.\n\nMr. Mills is a peculiar man, with a pinched face and beady eyes. \n\nHis illness does not appear to be particularly troubling, but I am rather concerned about the effect the poor airs around here may be having on him. Although there is still much controversy regarding the cause of the fever, I feel that some precautions must be taken. \n\nI recommend the man burn nitre and cleanse the room regularly with vinegar to help purify the toxic air. He tells me that he's certain he has some nitre that he should like to start burning immediately, but that it's in the cellar. As he is too weak to retrieve it himself, and his wife is nowhere to be seen, he asks if I would retrieve the nitre from the basement for him.\n\n[[Get the nitre.|fetch_nitre]]\n[[Leave.|leave_nitre]]</div><div tiddler="law_dropdead" tags="" modified="201402061215" created="201310202354" twine-position="1946,4456" modifier="twee">I recall hearing that another young lawyer by the name of John Todd is said to be still practicing in the city.

It was appropriated for use as a fever hospital due partially to its availability, but also because of its ideal location just outside of the city. Removing the sick from the city center protects the uninfected residents from their putrid exhalations, while at the same time, the fever victims themselves are offered respite from the oppressive, miasmatic airs of the congested streets and alleyways of Philadelphia proper.\n\nThe journey to the hospital is not a terribly long one, but it is long enough to reveal what a fearful sight the city has become. Wagons, loaded to the top with the bodies of the dead, wind through the streets. Meanwhile, windows are boarded and shops have been closed for fear of the deadly epidemic.\n\nAt least the hospital itself proves to be a much more uplifting sight.

Neither is a physician, and yet both have risen to the occasion at a time when many physicians are refusing to perform their sworn duties. I look forward to telling Sarah about these two commendable gentlemen and their exemplary fever hospital.\n\nI ask how they are treating these fever victims. Mr. Girard is a busy man, but he spares a few moments to show me around.

This is a troubling sign indeed, athough if I know him, he will fight with a stubbornness that only he can manage.\n\nAlthough this is all terribily disheartening, John reveals one last bit of information that provides a much needed glimmer of hope: some Fellows of the College of Physicians will be meeting this evening, and I have been welcomed to join them. \n\nDr. Kuhn shall be presiding over the meeting, and it appears that he had attended Dr. Hutchinson in his final hours. Drs. Kuhn, Currie and Barton have promised to attend, as will an assistant of Dr. Rush, Mr. John Redman Coxe.\n\n[[Go to the meeting.|physicians_3]]\n[[Forget the meeting, it is time to leave this blighted city.|failflee]] </div><div tiddler="physicians_3" tags="" modified="201405311613" created="201306011450" twine-position="3473,3253" modifier="twee">&lt;&lt;set $badges[16] = 'true' &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;popup 16&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;save&gt;&gt;\s\nArriving at the meeting, physicians all have very similar stories of their encounters with this yellow fever. Excruciating thirst, black, putrid vomiting, yellowing skin and eyes, and fever seem to be the predominant symptoms. Sometimes the illness seems to last for days, other times, it appears to come on suddenly, but in all instances, the fever seems all too likely to end in death.\n\nUnfortunately, the symptoms of the fever seem to be the only aspect of this illness that these men seem able to agree upon. Insofar as finding a cure, I am chagrined to discover that each has his own preferred, but unproven, method of treatment.\n\nDrs. Kuhn and Barton are in favor of the use of mild stimulants like wine, combined with the application of cool baths. Mr. Coxe, however, is adamant in advocating Dr. Rush's aggressive course of bleedings and purgatives. And then there is Dr. Currie, who has developed his own method of treatment, which he has recently circulated in pamphlet form. He advocates and abundance of fresh vital airs, tartar emetic in barley water, and regular cleansing of the patient's bed linens in vinegar.\n\nAs if those differences were not enough, each man seems to be determined in opposing the others' methods as strongly as possible. Currie denounces the bleedings of Rush and Coxe. &ldquo;Bloodletting results in a state of debility in the patient,&rdquo; he argued. Meanwhile, Mr. Coxe argues that mercurial purgatives could restore even the most debilitated patients, and insists that the baths advocated by Dr. Kuhn were too weak to have any effect at all. \n\nAfter nearly two hours of bickering and debate, the meeting at last adjourns. I am all too happy to at last [[depart for home|jj_sick]].</div><div tiddler="flee_end" tags="" modified="201402062301" created="201304122231" twine-position="4219,1799" modifier="twee">----\n&lt;&lt;set $ending[2] = 'true'&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $currentEnd=2&gt;&gt;\nYou have chosen to flee the city, a choice which nearly 20,000 other Philadelphians made over the course of the epidemic. \n\nSuch a choice was, in fact, likely to save your life and your family's.

Not only have I been kept busy attending to the sick and dying, but even the sources for news themselves seem to be withering under this unrelenting plague.

Maybe it is enough to save her.\n\nI find the paper at last. I read over the good doctor's words, but I am hardly certain that I trust my own eyes. Does he really recommend three doses of purgatives in a single day? \n\n&ldquo;Fifteen grains of jalap and ten of calomel. The evacuations should come quickly...&rdquo;\n\nI doubt that I would give a man twice Sarah's size such a dose of purgatives. And yet, knowing Dr. Rush, I am certain he would not suffer the printer to allow any errors.\n\nThe remedy continues, &ldquo;It is best to use the purgatives in conjunction with blood-letting and cold drinks in order to remove excess of stimulus from the system, for this overstimulation is the proximate cause of the disease. Once the bowels have been properly purged, take at minimum eight to ten ounces of blood from the arm.&rdquo;\n\nA hearty bleeding in addition to the calomel and jalap?! Truly, either Dr. Rush is completely mad, or... or absolutely certain that his remedy is the only way to fight this fever.\n\nAs frightened as I am of the prescription, I see no other choice than to carry it out.\n\nI prop Sarah up in bed and rush to my medicine chest. I readily find the calomel and jalap I seek, but I only have enough for the first two doses. I will have to find an open apothecary in the city before the morning.\n\nStill, I have enough to get started. I administer the first dose of purgatives, but with much difficulty. Sarah is barely able to swallow. I sit anxiously by here side and wait for the medicine to begin taking effect.\n\nBut my vigil is interrupted by the sudden cries of the baby Matthew. The children! How long have they been left to fend for themselves with Sarah collapsed on the floor, I wonder.\n\nIt seems I will not be able to pay Sarah my undivided attention after all.

I am having second thoughts about the wisdom of my jumping in.\n\nI am able to at least resurface and get my bearings. I should really like to find the nearest ladder climb out, but the crowd is now waving furiously at me to indicate where the girl was last seen. I suppose I have drenched a good suit for nothing if I do not at least look for the poor woman.\n\nI swim, if my awkward motions can even be called swimming, I swim over to the spot, but the girl is nowhere to be seen. I shall have to dive under the water's surface and see if I can find her.\n\nI draw in a large breath and plunge myself under the water. I open my eyes, but there is little I can see in the murky waters. I push a little deeper into the water and stretch out my hands. \n\nSomething brushes against my arm! Could it be the girl? \n\nI spread my arms wide and try to find the source, but I find nothing. My lungs begin to ache.

Few in our city who came as close to death as I did still live to tell the tale. \n\nI have a vague recollection of collapsing in the street, but little memory of what followed. From what I was told, the man with the dead took me to a nearby Quaker meeting house. I was delirious with fever and thirst, but they nursed me back to health. When I had recovered sufficiently, I was reunited with my family.\n\nNow, finally, a significant cooling of the weather this last week seems to have finally brought about an end to the wretched yellow fever. Why this is so, I cannot guess, but it is with mixed feelings that I contemplate the fever's departure. Of course, it brings me great joy to know that we no longer have to suffer in fear from this terrible affliction, and at last our city's dead can be properly mourned and laid to rest. \n\nAt the same time, however, this yellow fever remains a great mystery, and I am certain that our people have not seen it for the last time. I only wish that we had learned more about it while it was here. Perhaps if we had not been so lacking in the means of caring for the ill, panic would not have gripped those who remained. Perhaps there would have been more time for careful study and thoughtful contemplation of its mode of attack and mechanisms of transmission. Still, while the physician in me yearns to learn more about this dreadful fever, the man in me is grateful to have been spared.\n\n\nTHE END.\n----\n&lt;&lt;display 'ending tracker'&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="mugged_1" tags="" modified="201402260001" created="201304122226" twine-position="3106,2918" modifier="twee">I step out to door filled with new resolve to fight this terrible fever, and yet, I cannot quite get over the desolation of these usually well-trafficked streets.\n\nIt seems as though fear rules in this city tonight. Those who could afford to flee the city have done so, and those who could not have largely cut themselves off from civilization, so frightened are they of the disease. And yet, I suspect that this disease can likely seep through closed doors and infiltrate the most tightly sealed homes if it so desires. For all their fear of their fellow man, are these shut-ins truly any safer?\n\nMy thoughts are interrupted by the approach of a lanky fellow in a mottled waistcoat. I should say that I am grateful that there is at least one other brazen soul traversing the streets this evening, but he has fixed his gaze upon me in a most unsettling manner.\n\n&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo;\n\nThe lanky fellow knocks me in the head with a heavy, blunt object. Reeling, I crumple to the ground. My head is spinning, but I can feel him grabbing at me, rummaging through my clothing, taking my medical bag...\n\n&ldquo;Unhand me, sir. I am a physician!&rdquo;\n\nBut his searching hands do not stop at their task. He continues to probe my person. He takes coins from my pocket and pries my wedding band from my finger.\n\nI can see colorful patterns of light playing before my eyes.

Fortunately, Mr. Tilden's abode is not far.\n\nA brisk walk down Vine Street brings me to Mr. Tilden's house. I had feared the abscess might need another draining, but it looks to be healing remarkably well, and Mr. Tilden himself is in good spirits. I should say that my work here is done.\n\nThe next on my list is the young Holden child, who several days ago was showing early signs of scarlatina. As of yesterday, the case looked as though it would be a mild one, but I want to take no chances.\n\nThe Holdens are milliners, and their home is located at Fourth Street and Mulberry. It takes me little time to make my way there from Vine Street, but when I arrive, I am surprised to be greeted by a very anxious-looking Mrs. Holden. The child seems to be much improved, but she is alarmed by a sudden death in the neighborhood.\n\nShe points to a body being removed from an apartment across the street, and whispers to me that &lt;html&gt;&ldquo;&lt;/html&gt;a mysterious ague&lt;html&gt;&rdquo;&lt;/html&gt; struck the household. I wonder if [[this ague warrants investigating|abody]].\n\nThen again, it is more than likely a common illness, transformed into a thing of fear by vulgar gossip and superstition. [[I should not want to trouble myself|lunch]] over that kind of thing.</div><div tiddler="Intro" tags="bookmark" modified="201405311502" created="201304122319" twine-position="1410,570" modifier="twee">&lt;center&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;chpt-heading&quot;&gt;Chapter 1:&lt;br /&gt;Rumors and Omens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n\nAugust 22, 1793\nToday the weather promises to be warm and calm, as has been the pattern for much of the summer. June and July past were atypically hot months, marked by a most troubling drought that withered grain crops in the nearby countryside, dried up creeks, and baked the city's usually-free flowing effluvia into a stagnant and foul-smelling concoction. In addition, we have seen an amazing number of flies and other insects thriving under these oppressive conditions.\n\nBut I am pleased to note that the people of Philadelphia bore the vicissitudes of our scorching summer well. As a physician, I find myself particularly well-placed for witnessing the many merits of our city's diverse constituency, and I often marvel at their remarkable resilience in even the most trying, and sometimes tragic, moments of their lives. \n\nScarlet fever had been the reigning epidemic among the children in our bustling city since the early spring, but up until recently, the cases had not been especially malignant. I did, however, have the grave misfortune of losing a boy, a mere 7 years of age, to a severe case not two weeks ago. I can only hope that it is not a sign of things to come among my other scarlatina patients.\n\nI have also seen a great many cases of mumps making their way through our city's population of late. Mostly children have been affected, but a few grown men and women have also sought me out with the typical complaints of fevers, sore throats, stiff and swollen jaws, and difficulty swallowing. I have had to treat some of the most severe cases with gentle bleedings, but most cases were successfully brought to an end with warm wraps and blisters applied behind the ears.\n\nOf course the summer months were also attended with their usual hazards: every year many unseasoned migrants to the city will lose their lives to the fevers and influenzas of the sickly season. But these caused no more distress this July than usual. The extreme heat of the summer, which was especially pronounced this July, resulted in several fatalities. Most were suffered by our elderly residents, who are generally more susceptible to extremes of heat and cold than those in the flower of their youth. The remaining victims were country laborers at work harvesting crops of grain and grass. Still, it is hardly unusual for one or two such workers to give out every year under the unique heat and drought of the late summer months, and despite the occasionally fatal effects of these various hazards, the relatively mild diseases of this June and July pointed to an auspicious summer season for us. \n\nIn these final weeks  of August, however, there is the hint of a sinister change in fortunes. There is talk among the people, and even among some of my fellow physicians, of the presence of an ominous fever circulating around the docks. It is supposedly quite unlike anything seen in this city in recent memory, and it has been said that many cases of this mysterious fever have been rapidly terminating in death. \n\nI do not yet know how much stock to put into such rumors. I would be a fool to dismiss the possibility of a dangerous epidemic&mdash;Heaven knows I do not doubt the awesome and terrible power of Nature after the share of devastating ailments I bore witness to during the years of our great Revolution. Frightful outbreaks of small-pox and the bloody flux commonly ravaged our brave men and did more damage to some of our rebel camps than British bayonets ever did. Still, I hate to put any stock in frivolous rumors, and I have my doubts that this whispered disease is anything to fear. \n\nSome of our more excitable citizens have become unduly alarmed over some rotting debris left by the wharf on Arch street after the arrival of a ship from Saint Domingue. These well-meaning people have agitated themselves into a near frenzy with their belief that this foul mass is producing malignant airs believed to be the origin of this illness. I half suppose that there is no epidemic at all, save for one of epidemic madness brought on by over-worry.\n\nAnd yet, self-professed skeptic though I may be, here I am letting thoughts of this phantom epidemic consume my morning. The day does not get any younger and I have many tasks to attend to.

I look around to see if my knocking has raised any signs of life in one of the nearby apartments, but it would appear that the neighbors are committed to minding their own business.\n\nI lean my shoulder against the door and begin to push. It does not give way immediately, but the creaking tells me it won't resist for long. With a hearty shove, I manage to push the door open.\n\nLaying on the floor is a young man, who seems no more than ten or twelve years of age. Surely this must be Cook's grandson!\n\nI immediately check the boy's pulse. He is alive, but his pulse is slow and very feeble. Dried black vomit covers the front of his shirt. There is no doubt in my mind that it is the yellow fever.\n\nI carry the boy into his bed. I must get him something to drink.\n\nThere is nothing of use in this shabbily outfitted apartment. The neighbors are my only hope. I begin knocking on doors, but I am hardly surprised that no one will answer. \n\n&ldquo;I have already broken down one door tonight, must I break down another?&rdquo; I yell at no one in particular.\n\nPerhaps there is a nearby pub with an open kitchen. I fear that course will take too long, but I seem to be getting nowhere here.\n\nWhat is that? At the end of the hall&mdash;do I spy a door that's been opened just a crack? I do! And I can see someone peering out through the opening. \n\nAt being discovered, the door slams shut, but it is too late. I know there is someone there now and I will not relent. I dash down the hallway and begin pounding on the door. It does not open, but I am not discouraged.\n\n&ldquo;I know you're in there,&rdquo; I call through the door. &ldquo;There is a dying boy down the hall. You don't have to help, but I need clean water or broth. Something for the lad to drink. That's all I'm asking!&rdquo;\n\nI cannot tell if anyone inside intends to respond or not, but I have no choice but to wait and see.\n\nWith every second that passes, I wonder if I will find the boy dead when I return. I pound on the door again.\n\n&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; I yell, not bothering to conceal my desperation.\n\nAt last, I hear the bolt being drawn. The door only opens wide enough for a withered hand to shove a large cup of warm broth through it.\n\n&ldquo;Thank you. Thank you!&rdquo; I yell and fly down the hallway with the broth in hand. I pray that I am not too late.\n\nThe boy appears senseless, but he is still breathing. I give him some of the broth. I am able to get him to swallow a bit. I dare not bleed him given the condition he is in, but I shall stay the night and continue nourishing him.

Would they admit me or think me death incarnate?\n\nThere is no mistaking that this is an area hard hit by the fever, and this sad truth has only served to heighten the wariness of the residents here. People avoid public walkways, fearful that the fever may invisibly rage behind the walls of the adjacent buildings. In the street, greetings are perfunctory. Every man keeps his distance from every other. Those dressed in mourning attire are avoided as if they are the plague themselves. Everywhere the pungent odor of vinegar and camphor permeates, as people have taken to wearing the stuff about their necks and faces as a questionable means of warding off the fever.\n\nThe only instance in which caution has evidently been thrown to the wind is around the outgoing passenger vessel docked at the George Street Landing. Here men, women, and children are gathered en masse, pushing and bumping against one another in a chaotic dance. Each is jockeying for position in the hopelessly lengthy queue waiting to board. \n\nThey know they are late if they hope to escape the city. They know that every day the number of vessels willing to hazard a trip to the deadly city grows less. They know that soon, there will be no escaping.\n\nJust then, a woman dressed all in black steps forward into the crowd&mdash;a widow, no doubt, seeking safety just like everyone else. But her sudden appearance causes an odd surge in the crowd, as those nearest to her shrink away as though she were a viper.\n\nSuddenly, there's a loud crash, followed by gasps and a woman's startled cry. I move closer to see what has happened. \n\nIt would seem that in their haste to avoid the harmless widow, the surge of the crowd knocked a young lady off the docks and into the water. We can do little but watch in horror as the young woman, no doubt weighed down by her petticoat and lace, flounders and sinks below the surface of the water.\n\n[[Jump in after her.|watery_end]]\n[[Throw something to her.|no_way]]</div><div tiddler="what_now" tags="" modified="201403162316" created="201403162231" twine-position="845,2810" modifier="twee">&lt;span class=&quot;block&quot;&gt;Hurry man,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hurry&quot;&gt;decide!&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;choice1&quot;&gt;[[Take Sarah to Bush Hill.|wife_bush]]&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;choice2&quot;&gt;[[Begin treating her immediately.|wife_rush]]&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;&lt;timedgoto &quot;wife_rush&quot; 3s &gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="escape" tags="" modified="201403022217" created="201402061515" twine-position="4252,3387" modifier="twee">If I had any doubts about the man's honesty before, I must say that they have been confirmed by his unconvincing answer.

The ship is crowded with scores of other would-be refugees from the city.\n\nAs we approach the port of New York, a low murmur circulates among the passengers. Something is not right.\n\nWith some difficulty, I manage to track down a member of the crew. The news is not good: the ship is being denied entry to the port. No goods or passengers from Philadelphia are being allowed into the city!\n\nOur captain decides to turn the ship around and return to the city. Despite my hopes of safely removing my family from the situation, there is no choice now. For better or worse, we shall have to cast our lot with our fellow Philadelphians and hope that we can bring about a swift end to this frightening epidemic.\n\nI usher my wife and children home as quickly as possible. Although it is not yet dark, the days are growing shorter, and I am concerned by the looks of desperation on the faces of the few Philadelphians we see traversing the streets. My family and I may be forced to remain in the city, but I am not going to be cavalier about our safety. \n\nI have seen many residents choosing to board up their windows and doors and refuse contact with outsiders in an effort to keep the fever out of their homes.

What a horribly tragic night this is turning out to be. I wonder if child's parents remain trapped inside. But what house is this? \n\nNo. \n\nNo, it cannot be! \n\nI run to the pull-cart to which the drunken man had gestured. There, laid out like a scorched ragdoll, I see none other than my boy John, Jr. Rushing to his side, I look at his soot-covered body with despair.\n\n&ldquo;John! John, lad, can you hear me?&rdquo;\n\nAgainst all odds, the boy stirs. \n\n&ldquo;John, wake up, boy! What happened in there? Where are your brother and sister?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I'm so sorry, father,&rdquo; the little man sputters in a raspy voice. &ldquo;We waited and waited for you and mother to come home, but Louisa and I were so hungry and little Matthew started to cry and cry and wouldn't stop. I tried to light a fire in the wood stove to heat up some porridge. But the room started filling with smoke, and then flames began leaping out of the stove.&rdquo;\n\nHis story is interrupted with a horrible cough. The boy's breath now comes to him in gasps and wheezes, but he continues his horrifying description.\n\n&ldquo;I tried to save them, father, I tried! But it got so hot and so very hard to see. I just wanted to take care of them until you got home. Please don't be&mdash;don't be angry father.&rdquo;\n\nWith those words he began coughing again, this time far more violently than before. \n\nI do my best to comfort the boy. He grabs my arm tightly as he struggles for air, each cough convulsing his entire body. For the second time tonight, I can do nothing but watch a loved one suffer. \n\nThen comes one excruciatingly loud wheeze and John, Jr. stops moving.\n\nI look at my boy as he lies there in the pull-cart, still and charred.

The sound of the church bells ringing for the death of each new fever victim used to be my way of keeping track of the state of the city, but lately, they have ceased tolling.\n\nIt is a relief not to hear their mournful sound echo inside our sweltering home, but I don't believe for one second that the fever has yet passed, I still hear daily the sound of the wagons passing through the streets, the drivers calling out, &ldquo;Bring out your dead!&rdquo;\n\nRather, I suspect that either the churches have given up their tolling for the sake of the living, or worse, there remains no one to ring the bells. Whatever the case, I am finding the silence more ominous than the incessant ringing.\n\nMore worrisome still are the emerging signs of fever within my own home. Our baby Matthew, is, I am almost certain, nearing his final hours. He has been sick for almost five days straight. At first I thought maybe he suffered from the heat of the house, which had become quite oppressive after our decision to shut the windows and doors.\n\nHowever, two days ago we relented and opened some windows in order to take in cool breezes from the east. We succeeded in making the house tolerable, and at first the baby seemed relieved. But within a day, his crying resumed. This time, his restlessness was accompanied by vomiting and a yellow tint to his eyes.\n\nToday I awoke with a terrible headache, aching limbs, and a bit of soreness in my throat. Sarah likewise complains of aches and headaches. Is it the fever, I wonder, or are we merely depleted by our efforts to keep poor Matthew soothed?\n\nI confess I wonder now if boarding ourselves up within our house was a sound plan. After all, it seems it may not have kept us safe from the wretched yellow fever, and it has caused us much discomfort, not to mention alienation from our friends and neighbors.\n\nMy eldest boy, John, Jr. seems to be suffering from the confinement the most. He does not appear ill with fever, but ill with the restlessness of youth. Each day he looks at me with such sadness and longing, although he never complains. \n\nEvery day [[I tell him to stay strong|stay_inside]]... but maybe today, I should [[let him go|save_john]] gather news in the city.</div><div tiddler="angel_of_mercy" tags="" modified="201307152346" created="201307152346" twine-position="575,4656" modifier="twee">Where am I?\n\nAm I awake? \n\nAm I alive?\n\nWho's there?

I grew up in Albany, the son of a draper. From an early age my intellectual pursuits turned toward the scientific. I was fortunate to come under the tutelage of some of Albany's most accomplished physicians, but I longed to experience the best medical education that the colonies had to offer. \n\nI made my application to the medical school of the College of Philadelphia, and moved to the city in the summer of 1774. I took in anatomical lectures at the Surgeon's Hall on Walnut & Fifth Street, and I applied myself diligently to the treatment of the poor at Pennsylvania Hospital. I had the opportunity to work with some of the sharpest minds in medicine, including the estimable and accomplished Dr. Benjamin Rush.\n\nIt was with great ambition and sense of duty that I followed in the footsteps of Dr. Rush when he offered his professional services to the Continental Army as our colonies fought for their independence. There I bore witness to much suffering and hardship, only some of which proved remediable by my physician's skills. For every shattered limb I set and every fever I cooled, it seemed that five more died of injury or disease. It was a disquieting experience for a tender young doctor like myself, but adversity only renewed my commitment to the healing arts. At the conclusion of my services, I returned to Philadelphia and began to establish a practice within the city. \n\nIn that first year returned to the city, I was a man greatly preoccupied with dropsies, cataracts, fevers, pleurisies, and fistulas, and yet I knew my work would suffer if I failed to allow myself time for a little frivolity. I managed to spare a few evenings a week to attend the local dances. And what a fortuitous choice that was, for it was at just such a dance, on a blustery cold January evening, that I was lucky enough to attract the attention of a Miss Sarah Fitch&mdash;the fairest young lady in the room. \n\nThat lovely young lady and I went on to spend many an evening dancing together before I grew bold enough to court her in her own home. Although her father worried what kind of life a physician could provide for his daughter, his mild objections blissfully fell upon deaf ears, and Sarah agreed to become my wife. Within ten months we were wed, and a little over a year after, our first child, John Jr. was born.\n\nNow I am blessed to have three healthy, bright-eyed children and this month of August, in the year of our Lord, 1793, marks the beginning of my fifteenth year serving as a practicing physician in the fair city of Philadelphia. I pray that in the coming years we shall continue to be blessed with the same great fortunes we have experienced thus far.\n\n[[Let us begin our tale.|Intro]] </div><div tiddler="colddead" tags="" modified="201402232319" created="201309232348" twine-position="2700,1915" modifier="twee">I chastise myself for having ever followed that boy. I am now far from where my patients are and far from having done any work today.\n\nI am not quite certain what the quickest path away from this unpleasant part of town may be, but my heart sinks as I find myself across the street from the Three Jolly Irishmen, one of the most notorious establishments in the city.\n\nNoise and drunken sailors spill out of the debauched establishment. I put my head down and try to pass by the riotous scene without being noticed.\n\nIgnoring the loud choruses of their ribald drinking tunes, I walk as briskly as I can without breaking into a run. But it seems that luck is not on my side.\n\nJust as I approach a narrow entryway into one of the more garishly decorated buildings of the neighborhood, several women burst through the door and directly into my path. I cannot move out of the way quickly enough; we collide and one of the women falls to the ground. \n\nEmbarrassed to knock over a lady, I hasten to help her up. I extend my hand to aid her and then realize my mistake. This &ldquo;lady&rdquo; is no lady at all, but rather a harlot emerging from her brothel. Revolted, I pull my hand away and try to extricate myself from the scene as quickly as possible.\n\nAs I hasten away from these polluted women, the whore on the ground begins to shout curses at me. Suddenly, two burly, brutish men step out of the shadows and block my path forward. I try to brush them aside, but they will not be deterred.\n\nThey seem to be in the employ of the brothel-owner, protecting the house's &ldquo;goods&rdquo; from ruffians and thieves. I tell them to unhand me, but I find myself being dragged into a dark alley very much against my protests. I see the glint of cold steel flash in one of the brute's hands just before I feel it pierce my abdomen...\n&lt;&lt;set $paths[4]=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&gt;\n\n----\n&lt;&lt;set $ending[1] = 'true'&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $currentEnd=1&gt;&gt;\nYour ill-fate in Hell Town has put you out of your misery before the city's most deadly epidemic even began.\n\nDespite Dr. Brook's skepticism, a fever was indeed growing in Philadelphia, and between the months of August and November, nearly 20,000 Philadelphians would flee the city, while an estimated 5,000 others who stayed behind would die of a terrible and mysterious pestilence.\n\nBut, as you have discovered, the fever was not the only dangerous aspect of life in the city of Philadelphia in those days. Hell Town was home to many of the city's poorest and rowdiest citizens, as well as the city's many temporary visitors who landed at the busy docks on a regular basis. \n\nWhile not all of the residents had bad intentions, there was no shortage of lawlessness or characters of ill-repute in this part of town. Criminals, vagrants, prostitutes, gamblers, fugitive slaves, the disabled, and the insane all called Hell Town &ldquo;home.&rdquo; \n\n\nTHE END.\n----\n&lt;&lt;display 'ending tracker'&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="self_treatment" tags="" modified="201405061432" created="201307112339" twine-position="575,4516" modifier="twee">If I am being honest, I must confess that the headache alone is not my only symptom. Aching limbs and a bit of soreness in my throat leave me with little doubt as to what my future holds.\n\nRecognizing these symptoms early may be a crucial step in surviving this fever. But knowing how chaotic the city is now, I think my chances of finding sound treatment from another physician are grim indeed. My best chance of weathering this fever seems to be to treat myself. \n\nI shall begin taking purgative right away, and administer a bleeding this afternoon. Hopefully, if I am aggressive enough, like the good Dr. Rush, I shall survive.\n\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;div class = &quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/issues/2/2/fever/ellipsis.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\nMy first dose of calomel and jalap worked its magic, and in short time I produced copious evacuations. Dr. Rush would assure me that this is a promising development, but I am afraid it has done little to stop my aching or ease my weariness. My tongue and throat feel so unbearably dry. I must try to consume more cold fluids.\n\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;div class = &quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/issues/2/2/fever/ellipsis.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\nI remain steadfast in the application of Dr. Rush's proposed treatments, but I am not certain how much longer I will be able to administer them to myself. I have begun vomiting a foul  black substance. But I am relieved to say my thirst has diminished, even though at times I feel like my throat is barely open.\n\nI am too weak now to perform another bleeding and at this moment I feel terribly weary. But my spirits are much lifted from earlier. I am sure that with just &lt;&lt;if $meetpru eq 'true'&gt;&gt;[[a bit of rest|angel_of_mercy]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;[[a bit of rest|feverdeath_end]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;, I shall find myself safely carried through this crisis.\n</div><div tiddler="sickservant" tags="" modified="201304142158" created="201304142158" twine-position="439,1518" modifier="twee">&lt;&lt;set $maid = &quot;true&quot;&gt;&gt;\nI decide to see to the sick servant first. Although their illnesses may not be related, it is possible that the servant's current state may reveal vital clues regarding the prognosis of the clerk.\n\nA second housemaid leads me to the servant's quarters in the back of the building. Even though a small, east-facing window has been propped wide open, the narrow room is still quite dark and uncomfortably warm. The acrid scents of sweat and vinegar permeate the cramped quarters.\n\nI find the maid to be in a much-depleted state. My escort informs me that this is the fifth day of the old Irishwoman's sickness. She was in great distress yesterday, but today, her complaints seem to be of a comparatively mild variety. She still complains of great thirst, and her skin is dry and sallow, but the considerable vomiting that I have been told was taking place yesterday appears to have ceased altogether.\n\nThe previous physician prescribed a gentle dose of calomel as a purgative three days prior, and this seems to have brought the woman some relief. I can see why her sad, watery, sunken eyes are unsettling to the other members of the household, but no matter how her outward appearances affect the untrained eye, I cannot say that I see anything particularly exceptional about this stage of her illness. I suspect the calomel, combined with a regimen of broth and Madeira wine, will bring her to a full recovery soon. \n\nNothing that I see here convinces me that any especially malignant disease has taken residence under this roof. I am wont to simply recommend the Brewsters cease their unfounded worries and explain to them that [[I will not further indulge their fears|fearnot1]]. I could [[attend to the swooning clerk|swooningclerk]], just to be certain, but I worry that lending any further credibility to their concerns might be the very thing that enables total panic to at last overthrow reason's already tenuous grasp on the household.\n</div><div tiddler="move_along" tags="" modified="201404032117" created="201402042311" twine-position="2131,2993" modifier="twee">My wife always says that I must not let my curiosity get the better of me, and this seems like one of those occasions in which her advice is especially prudent. \n\nAs the carriage drives by, I put all thoughts of the woman out of mind and return my attention to the bigger issue: what can I do in the fight against this fever. \n\nThe driver steers the carriage onto Walnut Street and it occurs to me to stop by Dr. Rush's house and see if he has any news.  &lt;&lt;if $talk_to_rush eq &quot;yes&quot;&gt;&gt;I know he was only just starting to make sense of this disease when we last spoke, but perhaps he has made better progress now.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I regret that I was unable to call on him before now, but I am sure that my old mentor will have some insights regarding this fever.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nI tell the driver of our new destination and within a few short minutes, I find myself standing at Dr. Rush's door.\n\n&lt;&lt;display 'rushAgain'&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="how-to" tags="" modified="201406031406" created="201405311506" twine-position="708,150" modifier="twee">&ldquo;The Fever&rdquo; has 20 unique endings and 20 different achievement badges you can earn based on your choices during each playthrough.\n\nTo make it easier for you to know which paths you have previously taken, this game automatically stores your achievements locally to your browser.

When I arrive, the store seems to be in a state of moderate disarray.

One of Mr. Hieronymus Brewster's servants is said to be afflicted.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Is that so? Well, John, you should not trust blindly in everything you hear. There is no reason that I can see why we should fear for our lives just yet. And there is no certainty that Mr. Brewster's sick servant has anything at all uncommon.&rdquo;\n\nAlthough John says nothing, I feel I can detect a sense of disappointment in those precocious eyes. \n\n&ldquo;Still, perhaps I shall call on Mr. Brewster later today and see if I can offer any assistance.&rdquo;\n\nJohn's face brightens at last. He seems satisfied knowing that his father is on the case. Normally, I would delight in being the object of his boyish pride, but I can find nothing delightful about this unsettling news of the servant's illness. Sarah, too, seems disquieted by the revelation.\n\nAs I excuse myself from the table and prepare to depart the house and begin my rounds, Sarah quietly catches my attention.\n\n&ldquo;You're not really going over there, are you, John?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;To Mr. Brewster's? Possibly. Why?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I don't want that disease in my house, John. Think of our children...&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Sarah, please. As yet, there is no justification for your alarm. The disease is mostly likely spread by bad, noxious airs. You'd do more to preserve the children by keeping fresh-flowing air in the house than by forbidding me from doing my job.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;But you don't know for certain, do you? Perhaps it spreads as the pox does&mdash;by contact with an infected person. Please, John, just promise me that you'll stay out of that house until someone knows more about this.&rdquo;  \n&lt;&lt;set $paths[1]=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $track=1&gt;&gt;\n[[I cannot promise Sarah that I will stay away.|home_4]]\n[[I will promise to avoid the Brewster residence.|home_5]]\n</div><div tiddler="home_3" tags="" modified="201405311600" created="201304141835" twine-position="494,843" modifier="twee">&lt;&lt;set $shutup = $shutup + 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $shutup gte 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set badges[5] = 'true'&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;popup 5&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;save&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\s\n&ldquo;John, I am shocked by your lack of manners today. What kind of terrible question is that to raise at the breakfast table?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I heard some boys saying something the other day that God was sending a terrible plague to kill us.&rdquo; he says matter-of-factly.\n\n&ldquo;John, I am surprised at you,&rdquo; I scold. &ldquo;It is bad enough that a smart boy such as yourself would believe such a specious rumor, but then to repeat it like this, with your mother and sister present. Have I taught you nothing about discretion, son?&rdquo;\n  \nJohn looks somewhat stung by my sharp reply, but he drops the matter just the same. Sometimes, I simply cannot fathom where the young man gets his ideas or his impertinence. \n\nAs much as I hate to leave the table with such an awful question still lingering in the air, I feel that [[I should begin checking on my patients|patients]].\n\nThen again, I'm hardly in the mood, after hearing John, of all people, echo the same grim prognostication of a plague that I've been hearing all week. Maybe I will [[first stop by the City Tavern|tavern]] and listen to the local gossip over a pint before I begin attending my patients.</div><div tiddler="home_1" tags="" modified="201402232024" created="201304130056" twine-position="243,844" modifier="twee">Today I must check in on Mr. Tilden, whose abscess I lanced two days ago, but I should not like to miss breakfast.\n\nIt is always such a pleasure to be able to take breakfast with my devoted wife, Sarah, and our three lovely children. The baby Matthew is not yet two, but already he shows signs of great strength and intelligence. And little Louisa, whose fourth birthday is fast approaching, is a constant source of delight. \n\nI cannot deny, however, that the true apple of my eye is my eldest son, John, Jr., who is such an astute young lad that I often forget he is still just barely seven years of age. He is delicate in physique, but his keen eyes reveal a mental acumen which, if I am being truthful, I cannot claim to have possessed when I was a lad of the same tender age. This morning, however, he is particularly precocious, and he asks me a most curious question.\n\n&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he says, scrutinizing me with those piercing eyes of his, &ldquo;are we all going to die soon?&rdquo;\n\nI am aghast! Whatever could the boy mean by asking such a morbid question?\n&lt;&lt;set $meet_family = &quot;true&quot;&gt;&gt;\n[[Ask John what he means.|home_2]]\n[[Scold the boy for asking such an impolite question.|home_3]] </div><div tiddler="flee_1" tags="" modified="201402070015" created="201304122233" twine-position="4030,705" modifier="twee">As I leave the docks, I can't stop Dr. Rush's ominous words from echoing in my mind. &ldquo;Leave the city and stay away until this illness passes.&rdquo; I know that as a physician, I have some duty to put myself in harm's way to [[bring respite to the ill|stay]], but do I not have a duty to protect my family, as well? The only way I can see to do that would be to [[leave the city|flee_rush]].</div><div tiddler="allstay_sarah" tags="" modified="201310151647" created="201310151647" twine-position="4158,973" modifier="twee">I had not anticipated that Sarah would have such a strong position on the matter. I can understand why she does not want to see the family split up&mdash;it is certainly not an option that I had been looking forward to. Still, seeing her firm opposition to the possibility, maybe it was a choice that I was too hasty in considering at all.\n\nShould the worst come to pass, I suppose that I agree with Sarah that it would be better to suffer it together than miles apart. And I would much prefer to have my family under my own watchful eye rather than possibly suffering illness under the care of strangers. \n\nDr. Rush is a wise man, no doubt, and the time for flight may come eventually, but now is not the moment to be sending my wife and the children to travel alone into adventures unknown. \n\n&ldquo;We shall stay in the city a while longer,&rdquo; I tell Sarah.\n\n&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; Sarah replies. &ldquo;If there is a fever here, John, we will weather the storm together.&rdquo; I do worry if I am doing the right thing, but I take comfort in the look of strength and resolve on my wife's face. \n\nNow, although I would like nothing more than to investigate this fever, I do have patients who are expecting my attention today. If I am going to remain in the city, I should not spend this time neglecting my patients. I give Sarah a kiss and make haste to the home of my first patient, Mr. Swan Tilden.\n\n&lt;&lt;display &quot;patients&quot;&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="run_away" tags="" modified="201403022004" created="201402061232" twine-position="3874,3230" modifier="twee">&lt;&lt;set $paths[19] = 'true'&gt;&gt;\n&ldquo;I'm sorry, Sir,&rdquo; I say to the wiry man, &ldquo;but my mind is made up. The Mayor shall have to wait.&rdquo; \n\nTurning to the priest, I ask him to continue to lead the way to Willing's Alley. He looks at me with surprise, but makes no objection.\n\nWe walk along in silence a few moments, and I am relieved that the strange man does not seem to be following.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems my relief came too soon, for I am certain now I hear footsteps racing up from behind us.\n\nTurning, I see the thin man bearing down on me with a pistol drawn. \n\n//A pistol!?//\n\nI am certain I have no idea what this man's vendetta with me is about, but I am not sticking around to find out.\n\n&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; I say to the priest.\n\nI take off as fast as my feet with carry me. I am no athlete, but I am hoping I will not need to run far. I'm sure if I can just make it to the corner, I can lose the man in one of the alleys around here.\n\nI am almost to the corner now. I glance behind me to see how close my pursuer is. I seem to have pulled away quite a bit. I cannot hear his words, but I can see the man is bellowing furiously at me.\n\nI burst triumphantly into the intersection and quickly scan the street for the most promising route of escape. \n\nSuddenly, I feel a most curious sensation of being knocked off my feet. I'm sure I hear the loud whinny of a startled horse just before I hit the ground. I should have looked for carriages before dashing into the intersection!\n\n&lt;html&gt; &lt;div class = &quot;image&quot;&gt; &lt;img id=&quot;carriage&quot; src=&quot;../img/carriage.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;p class = &quot;caption&quot;&gt;Suddenly I feel a most curious sensation...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\nSomething hard and heavy crashes down upon my leg. Another falls upon my chest. \n\nI can't breathe...\n\n&lt;&lt;display 'horse_end'&gt;&gt;\n\n</div></div>
